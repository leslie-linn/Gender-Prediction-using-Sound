# Gender-Prediction-using-Sound
Analyze the gender distribution of children's book writers and use sound to match names to gender.

First, using fuzzy (sound) name matching, you will search for author names in a dataset provided by the US Social Security Administration that contains names and genders of all individuals who have applied for Social Security Cards. 
Next, aggregate the author dataset by including gender. 
Finally, use the new dataset to plot the gender distribution of children's picture books authors over time.
